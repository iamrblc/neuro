# AUDIO SIGNAL PRESENTER FOR THE HD-DOT LAB

This script will present pseudo-randomized audio snippets that can be used
for the setup at the HD-DOT lab.

It is based on 'Repetition enhancement to voice identities in the dog brain' (Boros et al, 2020) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60395-7

Not meant to be generalized for broader use, however it can be used as a template for similar works.
